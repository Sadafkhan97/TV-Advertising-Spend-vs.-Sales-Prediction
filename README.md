#TV Advertising Spend vs. Sales Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales. By building a predictive model, we aim to understand how advertising expenditure impacts sales, providing insight into potential sales outcomes based on advertising budgets.

##Project Overview

This project involves:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.

-Data Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets.

-Model Training: Using the LinearRegression model from sklearn.

-Model Evaluation: Testing model accuracy with the testing dataset.

##Getting Started

Prerequisites

-Python 3.7+

-Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

##Installation

Clone the repository:

https://github.com/Sadafkhan97/TV-Advertising-Spend-vs.-Sales-Prediction

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage

-Load the dataset.

-Run linear_regression.py to execute the EDA, train the model, and visualize the predictions.

-Results include a scatter plot of TV advertising vs. sales with linear regression prediction lines.
