##TV Advertising Spend vs. Sales Prediction
This project uses a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales. By building a predictive model, we aim to understand how advertising expenditure impacts sales, providing insight into potential sales outcomes based on advertising budgets.

#Project Overview
This project involves:
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.
-Data Preprocessing: Splitting data into training and testing sets.
-Model Training: Using the LinearRegression model from sklearn.
-Model Evaluation: Testing model accuracy with the testing dataset.

#Getting Started

Prerequisites
-Python 3.7+
-Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

#Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tv-sales-prediction.git

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
-Load the dataset.
-Run linear_regression.py to execute the EDA, train the model, and visualize the predictions.
-Results include a scatter plot of TV advertising vs. sales with linear regression prediction lines.
